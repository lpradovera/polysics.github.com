The menu DSL will be receiving a major overhaul in Adhearsion 2.0 to
make the syntax more clear and add new functionality while keeping the
core concepts.

Call Controllers
----------------

AHN 2.0 will be using a routing architecture and call controllers
instead of dialplan.rb.
The final structure is still being finalized, and
the following examples will be presented under the assumption that a
*CallController* will look like the following

{% highlight ruby %}
# A CallController has a run method that handles all interaction
class MyOtherController < Adhearsion::CallController
  def run
    speak 'foobar'
  end
end

# the following will reside in routes.rb and route any call to MyController
route :to => MyController
{% endhighlight %}

Current menu DSL
----------------

{% highlight ruby %}
# sample dialplan.rb
foo {
  menu "Press 1 to bar", "Press 2 to Baz", :timeout => 8.seconds, :tries => 3 do |link|
    link.bar 1
    link.baz 2
    
    link.on_invalid do
      speak 'Invalid input'
    end

    link.on_premature_timeout do
      speak 'Sorry'
    end

    link.on_failure do
      speak 'Goodbye'
      hangup
    end

  end
}

bar {
  speak 'Bar'
}

baz {
  speak 'Baz'
}
{% endhighlight %}

Proposed new structure
----------------------

The newer structure will improve readability of the code while keeping
existing functionality.

{% highlight ruby %}
# sample controllers/my_controller.rb
class MyController < Adhearsion::CallController
  def run
    answer

    menu "Where can we take you today?", :timeout => 8.seconds, :tries => 3 do
      match 1, BooController
      match /2/, MyOtherController
      match /3/, YetAnotherController
      match /4|5/, FooController
      match(6..10) { dar }

      timeout { timeout }

      invalid do
        speak "Sorry, that's wrong!"
      end
      
      failure do
        speak 'Goodbye'
        hangup
      end
    end
  end

  def dar
    speak 'dar'
  end
  
  def timeout
    speak 'Timeout'
  end
{% endhighlight %}

The *match* method takes an extension number, a regular expression or a
range, routing it to a *CallController* passed as its class name or a
block.

Old dialplan contexts will be removed and replaced by routing and
controllers.

*timeout*, *invalid* and *failure* replace *on_invalid*,
*on_premature_timeout* and *on_failure*. They are specialized versions of
*match* that accept the same types of call flow arguments.

The current controller will lose control of the call as soon as a match
is reached if it is routed to another *CallController*.

Internals
---------

The *match* method will be implemented as follows to avoid
naming collisions and scoping issues with dialplan methods.

The implementation is not complete and only shows block handling.

{% highlight ruby %}
class Menu
  def match(&block)
    controller = eval 'self', block.binding
    controller.instance_eval &block
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
